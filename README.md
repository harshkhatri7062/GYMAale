# GYMAale
### No excuses for workout anymore
This project is an idea to connect all the gyms in a city on a platform where different people from the city can connect with the trainers available on the platform,frequent travelers who are dedicated towards fitness can easily book gyms for a day or just for some hours and have to pay accordingly.
## The problem GYMAale solves
Frequent travellers often miss their workouts. This helps frequent travellers book a gym for a certain period of time or they can use up the card provided by us in the gym which has tied up with us. Also, this is a platform which connects all the gyms which are available in-out city. With the help of GYMAale, beginners can look at the best-suited gyms, trainers, supplementation and diet charts on free or paid basis and can consult trainers and dieticians as well.
## Challenges I ran into
There are certain challenges which I ran into as I started:
1) I didn't know how to code in python.
2) Geeting the forms and the necessary inputs so that the data can be managed efficiently.
3) The identification which the person who is booking a gym will use to prove that he has genuinely booked the gym.
4) Managing the part of the transaction.
5) How will the communication between the trainer and the customer take place?

By learning with time I solved many of these issues.
1) it took me around 20-25 days to learn complete flask and build some minimal projects in it and then I started building this.
2) I asked from a few of the gym trainers and my friends who go to the gym so they suggested me few things which the form should have.
3) For the problem of identifying a solution to send a 6-digit security code on every booking is sent and we are planning to soon add a feature where the code will be converted into a QR and can be scanned through which the genuineness can be there automatically.
4) This was the most difficult part as there were many things to deal with when a transaction takes place. I have pretty much solved 70% of the transaction issue but some of this is still pertaining.
5) For this, a protocol is set for the trainer that he has to compulsorily communicate with the customer with-in 8 hrs of booking. If he fails to do so without any good reason then his account is terminated. Also, there might be chances that some problems or prior commitments are there due to which he can't interact with the customer in the given hours then he as to let the GYMAale team know about it so customer support can deal with this.
